# AI Prompts Used in Development

This project was built with AI assistance. As a Python developer learning JavaScript for this project, I used AI to help with syntax, debugging, and best practices.

## Key Prompts Used:

### 1. Initial Project Setup
"I need to build an AI-powered application on Cloudflare Workers with LLM integration, workflow coordination, user input via chat, and memory/state management. I'm a Python developer with limited JavaScript knowledge. Help me understand the architecture and implementation."

### 2. JavaScript Syntax Translation
"Convert this Python async function to JavaScript:
```python
async def process_message(message):
    history = get_history()
    response = await ai.generate(message)
    save_history(response)
    return response
```"

### 3. Cloudflare Workers AI Integration
"How do I integrate Llama 3 model with Cloudflare Workers? Show me the code for calling the AI model and handling responses."

### 4. Memory Implementation
"Implement session-based conversation memory that persists across messages but stays isolated per user."

### 5. UI Development
"Create a modern chat interface with dark/light mode toggle, message bubbles, and typing indicators. Make it responsive and professional."

### 6. Debug Assistance
"Getting 'NotFoundError: Failed to execute insertBefore on Node' error when sending messages. How to fix DOM manipulation issues?"

### 7. Deployment
"How to deploy a Cloudflare Worker using Wrangler CLI and set up the proper configuration?"

## Learning Journey
- Started with zero JavaScript knowledge
- Learned async/await patterns (similar to Python)
- Understood Cloudflare Workers architecture
- Implemented real-time chat functionality
- Added advanced features like theme persistence
- Completed in 1 day

## Tools Used
- Claude AI for code assistance and debugging
- Cloudflare documentation
- Wrangler CLI
